/**
 * The Imperial / Metric / Custom control and the eleven per-quantity selects.
 *
 * ★ WRITER-AGNOSTIC ON PURPOSE. It holds no state, performs no request and
 * knows nothing about accounts: it renders a preference plus a resolved set and
 * hands its caller a complete `UnitSetSelection`. `UnitPreferencesCard` supplies
 * the account writer (`PUT /auth/me/units`, or `unitPrefsStore` for a client
 * with no account); the instance-default settings row is a second writer for
 * the same controls. Before this file there was no reusable editor at all, only
 * one monolithic block inside `SettingsSystemTab`, so a second consumer had no
 * choice but to write a second set of eleven controls.
 *
 * ★ THE CONFIRMATION LIVES HERE, NOT IN THE CALLER. Choosing a preset CLEARS
 * every override column (D3), and v1's behaviour was the opposite: "toggling
 * back keeps your tuning". A user who learned that loses a set they expected to
 * be remembered, so the warning has to precede the write. It belongs to the
 * control rather than to the writer because both writers clear the same way,
 * and a confirmation the second one forgot would be invisible.
 *
 * ★ AND IT NAMES THE GALLON CONSEQUENCE. Both canonical presets are written
 * with `secondary_gallon='us'` (`app/constants/units.py`), so a UK-gallon client
 * choosing Imperial lands on US gallons: a 20 percent move in every volume and
 * every MPG, from a button labelled with the system it is already on. R4.
 *
 * ★ `compact` IS THE QUICK SETTINGS LAYOUT. A 400 px drawer cannot take the
 * page's: eleven selects left open push every other preference out of sight,
 * so under Custom they sit in an accordion, closed until asked for. And the
 * confirmation above is a full-screen overlay on the page, which is no place
 * to send someone from a drawer, so in compact mode it appears in place under
 * the buttons (`InlineConfirm`, which the overlay also renders).
