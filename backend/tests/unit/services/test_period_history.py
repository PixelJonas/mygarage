"""`validate_period_history`: the write-side twin of the projection's guards.

The projection suppresses a figure when a tire's periods contradict each
other. Until this validator, the same contradictions could be WRITTEN: a
dismount dated before its own mount, a remount at an odometer below the last
dismount. With dates on every dialog those shapes become reachable from the
UI, so they are refused at write time instead.

Every rule has a fixture that passes without it. Kill check per rule: delete
the rule, the test named for it fails.
