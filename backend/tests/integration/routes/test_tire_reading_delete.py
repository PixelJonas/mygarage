"""Deleting a tread reading: the way out of a reading logged with the wrong odometer.

Log Reading does not validate against the mount history, and the writers that
do (mount, dismount, retire, rotate, set fit, the period editor) refuse any
write that leaves a period contradicting a reading. So one mistyped odometer
made every honest write to that tire a 409 with nothing able to remove the
reading. The refusal now names the reading, and this route removes it.

A reading leaves three things behind that the delete has to account for: the
tread and pressure it may have copied onto the tire, the vehicle odometer
record it published, and the low-tread reminder the copied tread may have
raised.
