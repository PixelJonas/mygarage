"""Mounting, rotating, retiring and deleting a tire.

The distinction this file is mostly about: **retiring a tire is not deleting
it**. This release is the one that makes tire history worth keeping, and the
ordinary act of replacing a worn tire was a hard DELETE that cascaded through
every reading and every mount period. Shipping the mount-period model beside an
unchanged delete would mean the first thing a user does after collecting a
season of data is erase it.
