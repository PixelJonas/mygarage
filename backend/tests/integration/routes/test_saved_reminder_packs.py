"""Saving a vehicle's schedule as a reusable pack, and applying it back.

A pack item and a maintenance rule carry the same columns, so saving is a
projection of `vehicle_maintenance_rules` and applying feeds the existing
pipeline. What the columns do NOT capture is that the pipeline resolves an item
to a rule by `maintenance_type`, which is why a typeless rule and two rules of
one type are refused at save rather than silently reshaped. Most of this file is
that contract and the access rules around publishing a pack.
