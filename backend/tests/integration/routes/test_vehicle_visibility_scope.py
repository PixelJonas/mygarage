"""One rule, four surfaces: which vehicles a caller may see in a LIST.

This is the read side of the authz rubric, and it had almost no coverage. The
rule lives in `auth.visible_vehicles_filter` and was restated inline at four
places; making that helper return None unconditionally (a full visibility
escalation, every caller sees every vehicle) failed exactly ONE test in a suite
of 5133, `test_calendar.py::test_calendar_excludes_non_owned_vehicles`. The main
vehicle list, garage analytics and the search/inbox pair caught nothing.

That is the same gap that let the admin branch go missing twice: search and the
notification inbox each grew a byte-identical copy of this condition WITHOUT it,
so an admin could open a vehicle's page but could not find it in search or
receive its reminder alerts. A rule with one test and four call sites is a rule
that gets re-derived slightly wrong.

So every surface is asserted here, in both directions, because the two failures
are opposites and a test for one does not see the other:

* a caller who should NOT see the vehicle does not (a leak), and
* a caller who SHOULD see it does (the admin branch going missing).

Calendar is listed for completeness and tested in `test_calendar.py`; it is the
one surface that was already pinned.
