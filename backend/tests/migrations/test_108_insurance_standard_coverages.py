"""Tests for migration 108 — free-text coverage limits become standard rows.

Parameterized over SQLite *and* PostgreSQL via ``engine_for_migration``,
because the two take completely different routes to dropping a column: SQLite
rebuilds the whole table, PostgreSQL runs one ALTER. The conversion itself is
pure, so its edge cases are also tested without a database.
