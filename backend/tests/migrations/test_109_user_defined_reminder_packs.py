"""Tests for migration 109 - the tables that hold user-saved reminder packs.

Additive only, so most of the risk is not in the data (there is none to move)
but in the ORDERING: `metadata.create_all` runs BEFORE migrations, so these
tables may already exist, may not, or may exist as only one of the two after an
interrupted run. All four states are exercised here, on both dialects.
