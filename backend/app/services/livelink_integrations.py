"""Status rules for the LiveLink integrations card.

Pure functions. No database, no broker, no clock of their own: `now` and the
timeout are injected so every rule is testable without sleeping, and so the
card's four dots cannot drift into four different nested ternaries in JSX the
way the single dot they replace did.

`status` is one of 'ok' | 'attention' | 'off'. `reason` says why, because the
status and the counts together cannot distinguish an unlinked device from a
linked one that has never reported: both are 'attention' with zero online.
