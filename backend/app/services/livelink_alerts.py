"""When a LiveLink reading's alert lines notify.

A reading may carry three lines on its `LiveLinkParameter`: a low warning
(`warning_min`), a lower critical one (`critical_min`) and a high one
(`warning_max`). A value past a line is in that line's band.

Most readings (WiCAN's) notify on every reading past a line, held back only by
the alert cooldown. A preset sensor's readings notify once per crossing
instead: a propane tank below its low line stays there for days, and the
cooldown would repeat the same alert every half hour until the refill. So they
keep the band they last notified in `alert_state`, notify again only for a
worse one, and re-arm once the value is clear of the line.
