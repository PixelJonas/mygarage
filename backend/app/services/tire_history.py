"""Refuse a tire history that contradicts itself, at write time.

The projection already knows the shapes that make a per-tire figure
meaningless: a period whose bounds run backwards, two periods claiming the
same kilometres, dates and odometers that describe two different histories.
It handles them by withholding the figure. This module applies the same
rules, plus one the projection never needed, BEFORE the write commits, so
the contradiction is refused with a sentence instead of stored and explained
later.

The extra rule is date overlap. The projection is odometer-based and never
needed it; an editor that lets a user type dates does, because a tire is
never in two places on the same day.

Pure. Takes ORM objects but touches no session, so the unit tests build
periods in memory, and every writer calls it over the tire's RESULTING period
list after a flush and before the commit.

    The invariant is that a vehicle's odometer does not run backwards in
    time. Relating a reading to a period's mount and dismount, that
    invariant yields four implications, all enforced here:

    1. A reading dated AFTER `dismounted_on` cannot read BELOW
       `dismounted_odometer_km` (the odometer would have to have gone down
       since the dismount).
    2. A reading dated BEFORE `mounted_on` cannot read ABOVE
       `mounted_odometer_km` (the odometer would have to go down between the
       reading and the mount).
    3. A reading dated AFTER `mounted_on` cannot read BELOW
       `mounted_odometer_km` (the odometer would have to have gone down
       since the mount).
    4. A reading dated BEFORE `dismounted_on` cannot read ABOVE
       `dismounted_odometer_km` (the odometer would have to go down between
       the reading and the dismount).

    A violation of any of the four means the dates and the odometers
    describe two different histories, which is what an odometer reset looks
    like.

    Every comparison is STRICT on the date, never `>=`/`<=`. These dates are
    day-granular, so two events recorded on the same calendar day cannot be
    ordered: a tire legitimately measured on the morning of its mount day can
    read slightly below the mount odometer, because the vehicle was driven
    between the measurement and the mount later that day. On the boundary
    day the true order is unknowable, so it must not be judged. The same
    applies symmetrically to a reading taken on the day of a dismount.

    Stated as monotonicity, NOT as range membership. An earlier revision
    asked whether a reading's odometer fell inside a period's odometer range
    while its date fell outside that period's dates, which assumes an
    odometer value identifies a date. It does not: a parked vehicle holds one
    odometer reading across many days, so a tire dismounted at 12,000 and
    measured in storage two days later at 12,000 was rejected as corrupt, and
    two periods sharing an endpoint odometer rejected each other's boundary
    readings.

    Only bounds that are actually known take part. A null is unknown, not
    wrong, which is what keeps the migrated assumed period out of this.

    Pairs, not period ids, and here rather than in `tire_service`: the
    projection needs only which periods to withhold a figure over (its
    `_odometer_goes_backwards` reduces these pairs to ids), while a write-time
    refusal has to name the READING, because a mistyped reading is as likely
    as a mistyped period and deleting it is the repair. One rule, two callers.
    Each pair appears once however many implications it violates, in the
    order of `periods`, then of `readings`.

    Writers before v3.4.0 committed without validation, so a tire can carry
    two independently contradictory legacy periods. Refusing every fault
    would make that history unrepairable (fixing either period leaves the
    other) and the tire undismountable. A write is judged on what it changed:
    a fault that was already there, on periods it did not touch, survives and
    stays flagged on the wire, to be repaired in its own turn. Judged on
    PARTICIPANTS, not on the intruder alone: touching either side of a
    persisting overlap counts against the write by default; whether the write
    still goes through depends on the full key set, below. An edit that only
    makes the overlap worse, resolving nothing else, is refused.

    The faults about a touched period come first, keeping their order among
    themselves: a writer raises the first one, and the sentence a user reads
    should be about the change they just made.

    "Introduced" means the period now carries a CODE it did not carry before:
    a fault is new when its `(period_id, code)` was not faulted in `before`.
    The counterpart is deliberately left out of that test. Rules 3 and 4a name
    every earlier period a later one contradicts, so their faults never change
    counterpart. Rule 4b still names a running maximum, the span holding the
    highest dismount odometer so far, so repairing that span hands the maximum
    to the next one and re-labels an untouched 4b fault against a different
    counterpart. Judged by the full key, that relabelled fault would read as
    new and refuse the honest repair. Nothing is lost by leaving the
    counterpart out: whether two untouched periods contradict depends only on
    their own bounds, so a write can change which counterpart an untouched
    period's fault names but cannot give that period a code it did not
    already carry, and a fault whose new counterpart IS a touched period adds
    a key nothing in `before` had, so it can never be part of a strict shrink
    (below) and is still refused through its participants. `FaultMap` keeps the full triple so each counterpart is
    still a participant.

    A write that leaves a touched period in a persisting contradiction is
    nonetheless accepted when the full fault-key set strictly shrinks: at
    least one fault key resolved, no fault key added. That is what makes two
    legacy typos that contradict each other repairable one period at a time,
    in either order. An overlap made worse without resolving anything leaves
    the key set unchanged, so it is still refused. A write that resolves one
    contradiction while enlarging another's magnitude is accepted, and the
    enlarged one stays flagged on the tire's history until it is repaired in
    its own turn. Rule 4b's running maximum and rule 5's one-fault-per-period
    already let several genuine contradictions share a single key, so a
    strict shrink can also land a brand new contradiction under a key some
    other period already carries: that period's own flag never goes missing,
    so the new contradiction gets its own key, and this rule's attention,
