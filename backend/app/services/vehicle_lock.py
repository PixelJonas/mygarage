"""Serialise the writers that change where a vehicle's tires are.

The rule "one open mount period per corner per vehicle" cannot be a database
constraint: `tire_mount_periods` carries no `vin`. It is enforced by a
check-then-write in the service, and a check-then-write is only correct if
the two halves cannot interleave with another request's. This module is the
mechanism that stops them interleaving.

Why the VEHICLE row and not the tire row: two different tires being mounted
at FL would lock two different tire rows and never contend. The rule is per
vehicle, so the lock is on the shared parent.

Why not `with_for_update()` alone: SQLite has no `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` and
SQLAlchemy compiles it away silently. Worse, the pysqlite driver runs every
statement before the first write in autocommit, so the occupant check and the
write were not serialised on SQLite at all. "SQLite's single writer serialises
anyway" is true of the WRITES and false of the check that precedes them.
Measured on 2026-09-12: two unlocked racers each saw zero rows and both wrote;
with `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` the second waited exactly the first's hold and then
read the first's row.

The contract, `LOCK_CONTRACT` below, is what the SQLite guard enforces and
what `test_tire_concurrency.py` spies on.
