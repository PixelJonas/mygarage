"""The Torque Pro Android app, over HTTP GET/POST.

Extracted verbatim in behavior from `routes/torque.py:_ingest`.

Declares ODOMETER as a CAPABILITY but leaves `sync_odometer` False. Torque
historically recorded no odometer at all: `store_torque_telemetry` never called
`_sync_odometer_from_telemetry`, and nothing Torque sends matches
`ODOMETER_PID_PATTERNS`. Flipping the storage policy would have started syncing
for every Torque user AND replaced the newer-only latest write. Instead the
capability opens the door and each DEVICE decides by naming its own
`odometer_param_key`; a device that names nothing behaves exactly as before.
