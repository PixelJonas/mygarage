"""Pydantic schemas for built-in reminder packs.

Pack format v2 (v3.5.0): an item declares a canonical ``maintenance_type``
and INTERVALS (``interval_km``, ``interval_months``, ``interval_days``,
``interval_hours``); applying a pack creates a per-vehicle rule from them.
The v1 keys (``due_mileage_km``, ``due_date_offset_days``, ``due_hours``,
``reminder_type``) are still accepted: the first three as aliases of the
interval fields, the last ignored, so a pack written for v3.4 still loads.
