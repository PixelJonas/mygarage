"""Add ``tires.storage_location``: where a tire is kept while it is off the car.

Free text on purpose. A garage shelf, a friend's basement and "the shop keeps
them" are all storage locations, and a lookup table would need managing for
what is, for nearly everyone, one string typed once a season. Requested on
#153 by IanVinkHub, whose seasonal-set comment shaped the mount-period model.

FATAL for migration 099's reason: the Tire ORM maps this column, so every tire
SELECT includes it and a silent skip would 500 all tire reads after the model
change.
