"""Turn each vehicle's free-text coverage limits into standard coverage rows.

Migration 107 made a policy a household record but left every vehicle's actual
coverage in one `insurance_policy_vehicles.coverage_limits` text box, where the
label and the amount run together ("Comprehensive Actual Cash Value $995") and
nothing can be totalled, sorted or corrected field by field. This replaces it
with `insurance_coverages`: one row per coverage from the catalogue in
`app.utils.insurance_coverages`, carrying its limits, deductible and premium.

FATAL, because the ORM no longer maps `coverage_limits`.

NOTHING IS DISCARDED. Each line of the old text goes to one of three places,
decided by the same parser the PDF import uses:

1. a line the catalogue recognises -> an `insurance_coverages` row
2. a leftover that splits into a label and an amount -> a named field on that
   vehicle, appended after any it already has
3. a leftover with no amount at all -> appended to that vehicle's notes,
   verbatim

So every word a user could read before the upgrade is still on that vehicle
after it, and the ones that were already structured data become structured.
