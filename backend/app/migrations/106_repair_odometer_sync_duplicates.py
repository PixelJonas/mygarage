"""Repair odometer rows duplicated by pre-fix auto-sync date edits (issue #171).

Before the fix, ``sync_odometer_from_record`` looked a source's own row up by
``(vin, date)`` only, so editing a fuel/service/DEF record's date left the
old-date row behind and inserted a second row with the same
``[AUTO-SYNC from <type> #<id>]`` marker. This migration collapses each such
group back to one row:

- The source record still exists (same vin): keep the row whose date matches
  the source's current date (newest id among ties); if none matches, keep the
  newest row and move it to the source's date. Delete the rest.
- The source is gone or belongs to another vin: keep the newest row, delete
  the rest (fuel orphans are already cascade-cleaned by migration 055's FK;
  this covers service/DEF leftovers).

Tire markers are excluded: tire rows are moved and deleted by the tire code
itself and may legitimately repeat the prefix across event kinds.

Not FATAL: this is a data repair. If it fails, the duplicates simply remain
(exactly the pre-migration state) and the app runs; the fixed sync also
self-heals a group the next time its source is edited.
