"""Add vehicles.distance_unit: the unit the vehicle's odometer reads (#172).

'km', 'mi', or NULL for "Account default", which keeps today's behaviour: the
vehicle's distances show in whoever is viewing's units. No backfill, so every
existing vehicle is NULL and nothing changes on upgrade. Storage stays
metric-canonical; this only decides how a vehicle's distances and speeds are
shown and read.

FATAL: the ORM maps the column and selects it on every vehicle query, so a
silent failure would boot the app against a missing column (the reason 080 and
096 are FATAL too). VARCHAR(2) is identical on SQLite and PostgreSQL.
Idempotent: the column is added only when absent.
