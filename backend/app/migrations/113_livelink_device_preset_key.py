"""Add ``livelink_devices.preset_key``: which preset created this device.

The integrations card names a preset-backed tab from its preset. Matching the
device ``label`` against a preset ``title`` at runtime would work today and
break the first time someone renames a device to something friendlier, so the
attribution is stored once instead of re-derived forever.

FATAL = True, like every other add-column migration here (096 and 112 both add
columns to this same table). ``create_all`` never ALTERs an existing table, so
a silent skip leaves the ORM SELECTing ``preset_key`` against a database that
has no such column, which breaks device management and all ingestion.

Two backfills ride along, because fixing the write paths cannot reach rows that
already exist:

1. ``preset_key`` for any generic_mqtt device whose label still equals a known
   preset title. This is the label-matching heuristic rejected for runtime use,
   applied once at migration time where it is safe: the branch is unreleased,
   so nobody can have renamed anything yet.
2. A ``livelink_parameters`` row for every topic map that has none. Mappings
   made through ``create_topic_map`` never registered a parameter, so the
   card's show-on-dashboard switch would PUT into a 404.

Preset titles are inlined rather than imported from ``app.services...presets``,
per the convention migration 096 states: a migration must keep working when the
live helper it would have imported has moved on.
