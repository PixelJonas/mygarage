"""Reset ``livelink_parameters.show_on_dashboard`` to TRUE everywhere.

The flag was written at registration by parameter class and read by no screen:
the Live tab has always drawn every latest value. So it drifted into meaning
nothing, and on a production copy it was FALSE on 36 of 53 parameters, most of
them WiCAN PIDs.

The integrations settings now expose a per-reading "show on dashboard" switch,
and the Live tab filters on this flag. Filtering on the drifted values would
hide those gauges on upgrade, with no switch anywhere to restore them: only
MQTT devices get switches. Setting every row TRUE reproduces exactly what the
Live tab showed before, so the filter changes nothing until someone flips one.

``archive_only`` is deliberately left alone. It has a real reader (the Charts
picker), and it is what keeps diagnostics out of it.

FATAL = True: the frontend filter ships in the same release. If this were
skipped, those gauges would vanish without an error anywhere.
