"""Switch LiveLink on for installs already receiving MQTT or Torque data.

Until now the "Enable LiveLink" master switch gated only the HTTPS ingest route
and the periodic jobs. The MQTT subscriber starts on `livelink_mqtt_enabled`
alone and the Torque route never read the switch, so both stored data with it
off. From this release the switch gates every ingest path. An install that
receives MQTT or Torque data today with the switch off would silently stop on
upgrade, so this turns it on for exactly those installs, once.

Evidence of an install receiving data, not merely configured for it:

- MQTT enabled with a broker host set, AND an enabled, linked non-Torque
  device (WiCAN, generic MQTT) that has reported at least once, or
- an enabled, linked Torque source that has uploaded at least once.

Both branches therefore mean the same thing: a device has actually delivered.

A fresh install (migration 034 seeds the switch 'false', and nothing else is
set) and a dormant Torque source that never uploaded stay as they are. Turning
the switch on also starts the periodic jobs (offline checks, daily summaries,
retention pruning, firmware checks) for those installs; that is what "LiveLink
on" has always meant.

FATAL = True: skipped, a working install's data stops with no error anywhere.
