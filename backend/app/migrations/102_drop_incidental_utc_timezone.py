"""Delete an incidental ``timezone=UTC`` settings row (household timezone fix).

Until this release nothing read the ``timezone`` settings row, and saving any
field on the Settings System tab wrote ``timezone=UTC`` as a side effect
(the select's seed default). Now the row drives every server-side calendar
date, so an incidental UTC row would silently pin a non-UTC container to UTC.

Policy (plan 4.3, a compatibility policy, not a preservation proof): delete
the row when its value is ``UTC`` AND the fallback chain without the row
(``MYGARAGE_TIMEZONE`` env, container zone, UTC) resolves to a zone other
than UTC. Every other row is kept and becomes live. The runner records this
migration, so a UTC value an owner saves afterwards is honoured. An owner who
deliberately picked UTC on a non-UTC container loses that choice once and
must re-select it; the release note says so.
