    Behavior:
        - Skips sync if odometer_km is None
        - A record this source owns (`_own_records`: marker or fuel FK, any
          date) is updated in place, INCLUDING its date. Editing the source's
          date moves the row instead of orphaning it (issue #171)
        - Otherwise, on `operation="create"` only, the newest record of the
          new date that no tire event wrote: if it was auto-synced or from
          livelink, takes it over (user-entered fuel/service data is more
          authoritative than LiveLink); if it was manual, does not overwrite
        - On `operation="update"` with no owned row (a same-day sibling's
          create claimed it, or it was hand-deleted), a fresh row is created:
          an update NEVER claims another source's row, because the row it
          would find on the destination date belongs to someone else and a
          later delete of this source would cascade it away (issue #171's
          side effect)
        - A record a tire event wrote (`is_tire_marked`) is never taken over:
          the tire moves and deletes it by its own marker, so re-marking it
          would remove the tire's reading
        - Otherwise creates a new odometer record with source marker

    With `claim_other_records=False` the source never touches a record it did
    not create. A record it owns has its value (and date) updated. Otherwise,
    when any other record on that date (manual, LiveLink, or another source's
    automatic one) reads at or above the figure (`reads_at_or_above`),
    nothing is written: the day already has a reading at least as high.
    Otherwise, with no record on the date or only lower ones, a record with
    this source's marker is created; being the day's highest reading, it is
    the vehicle's current reading for that day (the highest reading on the
    latest date).
    The tire paths publish this way: a tire event's record is later moved or
    deleted by marker, so a record it had re-marked would take another
    source's reading with it.

    Args:
        commit: When True (default) the helper commits and refreshes within
            its own unit of work. When False the caller is responsible for
            committing — the helper still flushes so the row gets an id and
            any FK side effects are visible to subsequent queries inside the
            same transaction.
        claim_other_records: When True (default) the one-reading-per-day
            policy above applies, and an automatic or LiveLink record on the
            date becomes this source's ON CREATE. When False, see above.
