"""Resolve a user's effective unit set, and seed a new user's columns.

D3: ``unit_preference`` is the BASE preset; any non-null override column beats
it, regardless of which preset is set. ``custom`` is a UI affordance meaning
"show me the ten selects", not a distinct resolution mode, so it resolves the
same way everything else does.

``resolve_units`` is deliberately PURE and synchronous: ``UserResponse`` calls it
from a Pydantic computed field, which cannot await. If resolution ever needs the
database, that computed field has to change with it.
