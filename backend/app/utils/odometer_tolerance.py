"""When two stored figures are the same reading.

v3.4.0 moved every unit conversion onto the exact definitions. A figure saved
before that was converted with a truncated factor and rounded to the column's
step, so the same odometer typed again today can land a few parts per million
away from its stored self: 89,044 mi saved as 143,302.07 km, retyped as
143,302.43 km. Anything that orders two odometers (a mount below a dismount, a
reading behind a period) would read that as the odometer running backwards.

One band, used by every odometer ordering comparison in tire history and tire
distance, so the two cannot disagree about what counts as the same figure. The
import duplicate check uses it too, but only where the drift can exist: a value
converted from miles or gallons in that import, against a row stored before it
(`app.routes.import_data._converted_value_matches`). Everywhere else in an
import, two figures inside the band are two different readings.
